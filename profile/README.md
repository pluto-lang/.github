Pluto is a new open-source programming language designed to help developers write cloud applications and **make it easier to use cloud services**.

Developers can directly use the **required resources, such as KV databases and message queues**, in their code based on their business needs. Pluto performs **static analysis** on the code to determine the **infrastructure resources** required by the application and deploys corresponding resource instances and applications on the specified cloud platform.

Let's look at a simple example:
